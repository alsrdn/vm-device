//! Traits and Structs to manage interrupt sources for devices.
//!
//! In system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or
//! software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor
//! to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is
//! executing. The processor responds by suspending its current activities, saving its state, and
//! executing a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal
//! with the event. This interruption is temporary, and, after the interrupt handler finishes,
//! unless handling the interrupt has emitted a fatal error, the processor resumes normal
//! activities.
//!
//! Hardware interrupts are used by devices to communicate that they require attention from the
//! operating system, or a bare-metal program running on the CPU if there are no OSes. The act of
//! initiating a hardware interrupt is referred to as an interrupt request (IRQ). Different devices
//! are usually associated with different interrupts using a unique value associated with each
//! interrupt. This makes it possible to know which hardware device caused which interrupts.
//! These interrupt values are often called IRQ lines, or just interrupt lines.
//!
//! Nowadays, IRQ lines is not the only mechanism to deliver device interrupts to processors.
//! MSI [(Message Signaled Interrupt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Signaled_Interrupts)
//! is another commonly used alternative in-band method of signaling an interrupt, using special
//! in-band messages to replace traditional out-of-band assertion of dedicated interrupt lines.
//! While more complex to implement in a device, message signaled interrupts have some significant
//! advantages over pin-based out-of-band interrupt signaling. Message signaled interrupts are
//! supported in PCI bus since its version 2.2, and in later available PCI Express bus. Some non-PCI
//! architectures also use message signaled interrupts.
//!
//! While IRQ is a term commonly used by Operating Systems when dealing with hardware
//! interrupts, the IRQ numbers managed by OSes are independent of the ones managed by VMM.
//! For simplicity sake, the term `Interrupt Source` is used instead of IRQ to represent both pin-based
//! interrupts and MSI interrupts.
